Having completed the first year of my PhD program without the absence of great pain, I figured it might be beneficial for me to summrarize my first year as it's been a long learning process. Making the leap from a small undergraduate program to a fairly good PhD program came with the realization that there were a lot of holes in my abilities and mathematical maturity, so the point of this post is to summarize those, reflect on what I could have done based on the lessons I learned, and look forward to what I want to do next year.
