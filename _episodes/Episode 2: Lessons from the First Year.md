title: "Episode 2: Lessons from the First Year"

Having completed the first year of my PhD program without the absence of great pain, I figured it might be beneficial for me to summrarize my first year as it's been a long learning process. Making the leap from a small undergraduate program to a fairly good PhD program came with the realization that there were a lot of holes in my abilities and mathematical maturity, so the point of this post is to summarize those, reflect on what I could have done based on the lessons I learned, and look forward to what I want to do this Summer and onward.

#### Looking Back
I'll start off by saying that CSU East Bay did not prepare me for a PhD in mathematics. I love the people I spent time with there, and my faculty were amazing and all came from impressive schools, but our department is small and I was a minority among my peers, many of whom had no desire to continue studying after their undergrad. This was perfectly fine and I'm glad they cater to the demographic that needs them. However, I only partially had the urgency to really work beyond my undergrad experience in preparation for the PhD. I had young energetic faculty to learn from, even one who recently graduated from my PhD institution, but even with all the hours I spent talking and learning from them privately, there were many things I could have gotten more insight on. To name a few:

1. What subjects should I be actively learning that will prepare me for coursework in the PhD program.
2. Productivity and Workflow. I.e. how to balance my time in the PhD program between coursework and TA responsibilities. What are some note-taking or LaTeX habits or apps that would benefit the process. 
3. How does one learn mathematics (it never hurts to hear what others have to say on this matter)
4. I should have spent more time solving problems on various subjects

With that being said, I don't think the insights I gained were meaningless. Although not being a first generation college student, I was the first in my family and social circle to pursure a graduate degree. Much of my time with my faculty was spent on the application and refining it, so I am thankful that I was able to make it into the school that I did, especially with the background I had.

Looking back on my undergrad, it certainly didn't help that I attended community college and then transferred. Doing so more or less fixes where you start as a Junior which leaves you with only 2 years to advance quickly course work as possible and do some kind of undergraduate reserach. On this topic, I have some regrets about my research as I could have gotten much more out of it if only I had the humility to ask more dumb questions. It was my first time reading any kind of research paper and working on a problem with no answer, so I attempted to tackle these things the same way I work on problem sets and read introductory textbooks. Needless to say, it didn't go so well. My professor and I produced quite a [pretty paper](assets/pdfs/Hausdorff_Measure_of_Classical_Fractals.pdf), but I don't consider the result anything novel. Sometimes, I feel my time would have been better spent solving problems and self-studying more, especially since the results weren't complete in time for applications. Nevertheless, I'm happy with what I could do in just 2 years

#### The First Year
I made the unfortunate decision to take both a year-long sequence of Algebra and a year-long sequence of Real Analysis. On their own, neither is so bad, but because they have nearly zero overlap in content, it becomes quite challenging balancing both. So naturally, coming from a undergrad department full of analysts, I sacrificed Algebra in order to succeed in Real Analysis. However, in reality, I just barely scraped by both. 

There are two things I'm especially displeased about with how I chose to study and learn this past year:
1. I was not honest enough in asking questions and being open about my lack of background. Being surrounded by peers that, at least on the surface, seem like they know what they're doing put a lot of pressure on me to also sit back in silence and nod my head to the strange language being spoken during lecture. I squandered several opportunities with incredibly kind and generous professors to be open and properly learn from them. I now know that graduate courses are a lot more fluid in that professors will make certain adjustments based on what students know and don't know, so for the future, I am trying to take advantage of this and most importantly, being honest.
2. I did not do enough to prepare myself to learn. By this, I mean reading the text, or rereading the previous lecture. Too often did I go into a lecture, having completely forgotten the content of the previous, when in fact, had I just skimmed the previous one, my understanding of what would be lectured on would have increased dramatically. I think, for myself, that I need to typeset my notes, or some kind of notes. My handwritten scratch does not suffice as something to reference, and the idea that "I have the textbook to reference later, so why should I take notes" is no longer feasible. Graduate textbooks lean too far towards brevity for me to use them as references when I haven't even learned the material the first time over. 

However, I will also say that I think I was too hard on myself and I lost a lot of the joy of studying mathematics that I had in undergrad. COVID certainly didn't help and being remote for one's first year in a PhD program is a ridiculous idea. I avoided online courses my entire life, so to suddenly have to take extremely tough courses online while TAing online during a global pandemic just sounds like as much of a disaster that can happen. My mental health and physical health suffered intensely, and only now do I have the opportunity to begin to mend them.

One thing that did help during this year was being part of UCR's Graduate Student Mentorship Program. My peers and mentor were so empathetic and it was comforting and reassuring just to know that we were all going through pretty awful times. Communication and kindness were vital for me to make it through the year, so I'm going to cherish that sentiment going forward. 

#### Looking Forward
It's already been somewhat said, but I need to improve (or actually learn) how I learn math. Things were far too easy in my undergrad (
