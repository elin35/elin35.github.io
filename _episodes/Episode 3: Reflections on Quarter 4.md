I guess the first overdue announcement is that I passed my Real Analysis qualifying exam at the start of Fall quarter. This came as a very nice surprise as I am still confident that I had no business passing that test. The test is formatted into 4 subsections. I've described them loosely below, but there's a heavy amount of overlap and hopping around of certain quesitons. Overall, the test covers undergraduate real analysis and the first 9-10 chapters of Folland.

- Undergrad type problems 
- Problems pertaining to integration and measure theory
- Problems pertaining to differentiation and functional analysis
- Problems pertaining to Fourier analysis and $L^p$ theory

Each section has 4 problems and we are tasked to choose 2 to solve out of each section. I attempted 6 problems and had a few mistakes on some of them, so it really is a miracle that I passed. Either way, I'm very happy to have checked off one milestone towards my degree, and I'm still very fond of real analysis. I will probably make a separate post just about studying for qualifying exams later on. I still have one more (likely in Partial Differential Equations), so I'll be looking forward to that.

#### Reflections on my courses
After taking Real Analysis and Algebra, whatever was left of my confidence led me to register for the Differential Equations sequence and the Applied Math sequence. Take that to mean whatever you'd like it to mean. This first quarter, my courses were Ordinary Differential equations, which focused on qualitative analysis of various types of linear and nonlinear systems of first order equations, as well as Probability Theory. 

I very much enjoyed the content of ODE. The types of problems definitely felt closer to undergraduate analysis and it was nice to see a more qualitative approach to analyzing linear systems as opposed to the strangeness that is the undergraduate ODE experience. I do agree with [Rota](https://web.williams.edu/Mathematics/lg5/Rota.pdf) for the most part about this, so this class was a lot of fun. Even existence theorems were more interesting than I would have initially thought. I hope to continue looking into ODE theory at least a bit more as it seems we were just about to reach some nice results by Lyapunov. One thing I'm not satisfied with were the exercises given to us throughout the course. We used Brauer and Nohel's *The Qualitative Theory of Ordinary Differential Equations* as well as Strogatz's well known classic, *Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos*. The exercises from Brauer were fine, but some from Strogatz definitely left something to be desired in terms of rigour. Some problems about bifurcations just leave too much to numerical approximation and heuristic observation for me to feel good about. I'm also not sure how to approach such problems in a satisfying way without passing to perhaps some topological argument (which I would have no knowledge on).
