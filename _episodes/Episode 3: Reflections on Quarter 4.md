I guess the first overdue announcement is that I passed my Real Analysis qualifying exam at the start of Fall quarter. This came as a very nice surprise as I am still confident that I had no business passing that test. The test is formatted into 4 subsections. I've described them loosely below, but there's a heavy amount of overlap and hopping around of certain quesitons. Overall, the test covers undergraduate real analysis and the first 9-10 chapters of Folland.

- Undergrad type problems 
- Problems pertaining to integration and measure theory
- Problems pertaining to differentiation and functional analysis
- Problems pertaining to Fourier analysis and $L^p$ theory

Each section has 4 problems and we are tasked to choose 2 to solve out of each section. I attempted 6 problems and had a few mistakes on some of them, so it really is a miracle that I passed. Either way, I'm very happy to have checked off one milestone towards my degree, and I'm still very fond of real analysis. I will probably make a separate post just about studying for qualifying exams later on. I still have one more (likely in Partial Differential Equations), so I'll be looking forward to that.
