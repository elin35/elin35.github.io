I was hoping to write this over the Summer, but between studying for my PDE qualifying exam, struggling to make progress in my reading course, and being alive, I did not have much time to do much else, and as usual, I had lots of ideas of things I could do in my free time that did not come to fruition.

(This may be my messiest episode so far because of how much I'm going to attempt summarizing and talking about so please forgive me for that. Also, I'm trying to write these without rereading my previous entries, so if I contradict my past self, it is my personal hope that this means that I am learning and growing from some kind of mistake or misjudgement. Either way, it'll be more interesting to look back upon one day. )

### Thoughts after finishing the coursework portion of the program
I'm actually very glad that the core sequences are over and my qualifying exams are passed (update: I did pass PDEs). Looking back, there are definitely things I could have done to better learn the material and excel in the courses as one would try to do for undergraduate courses. However, between juggling life and TA responsibilities while trying to to get a headstart on reading courses and finding an advisor, I don't think the time investment is worth it over learning how to better manage all these things together, i.e. understanding and being okay with not doing the best in courses, but beginning to mature into the program/department and finding your style of TAship and reading/communicating with professors. I think the first year is perfectly fine to buckle down in courses and leave other things for later, but the difficulty adjusting and huge ramp up in difficulty made that kind of impossible for me my first year. 

I've come to understand that to really truly understand the fundamentals of a subject, a huge time investment is absolutely needed for someone like me. To build up deep understanding, one requires both an intuitive understanding of the major results, but also a strong technical understanding of common practices and techniques. These come hand in hand. I came into grad school looking for that [post-rigorous](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/theres-more-to-mathematics-than-rigour-and-proofs/) and intuitive understanding, but I forgot that you can only reach that through technical mastery. To this, I mean that in order to feel comfortable with a major theorem or result in the sense that you know:

- Under what situations does it feel correct to try to invoke it 
- How small adjustments to its hypothesis may affect it
- Intuitively why the theorem is true
- Under what context led to the development of the theorem

The effort must start with knowing how to prove it by heart. This doesn't mean coming up with the proof on your own, but it very likely means memorizing the proof to the finest detail and understanding why such details are necessary. Such memorization allows one to then look past the technical detail and begin to build intuition in the sense above. In other words, it's about no longer needing to constantly reference back to the proof, or a text, so that you can move ahead in your understanding. This also isn't just about the theorem at hand. Proofs of major results often contain techniques and ideas that are commonplace in that subject.

These ideas came from conversations and comments heard from Dr. Estela Gavosto and Dr. Patricio Gallardo and to some extent my community college professor Raj Misra, who never failed to remind us of the value and importance of memorization. I'm sorry to say that I indeed forgot this. The very blunt way that I re-understood this was during the math education seminar where we were discussing aspects of learning mathematics from the perspective of undergrads. The aspect of "repetition" came up and I understood it in the sense that students do need to grind problem sets to build muscle memory in order to build intuition about patterns or properties of the objects they're working with (like integrals or limits). I asked how this extended to proofs and Dr. Gavosto's response was that there are many proofs that fit into certain categories which reuse similar techniques (template problems). I then asked about graduate level material such as understanding a big theorem, and her response was to be able to prove it without looking.

At another time Dr. Gallardo affirmed this stance by talking about this idea of grinding. Certainly, it's rote and often unenjoyable, but his approach was that it is unfortunately necessary. Mathematics is prized and valued in society. For many students from where he came from, mathematical ability can literally save them from poverty or a poor trajectory in life. Grinding for understanding, but also speed was a method of survival for some students, and this was another aspect that I could not see at the time. 

That being said, I am not trying to say that an eager student must memorize an entire textbook to get anywhere. Major theorems and their proofs are already more than enough on top of regular definitions. The idea is that once memorization occurs, and the inuition arrives, once those technical details are eventually forgotten, the inuition generally sticks and so do major techniques from those proofs. Thus, proving big results eventually sounds something like "We start with this kind of object, use this technique and this idea and the result is achieved". The details are lost, but that is now okay. 

As for the other aspects of courses, I am still convinced that typing up notes helps me understand them better, if only because I get a second pass at them. It also gives me something nicer to read than my own handwriting. I am still convinced that [this advice on homework](http://pi.math.cornell.edu/~zakh/homeworkguide.pdf) is really good. The only change I'd make is that eventually, you may have to call it quits and search online or "cheat". Dr. Amir Moradifam said it best, that some problems and exercises are literally results that were developed over decades of professional mathematicians struggling. To then expect a regular kid to come to the idea of the proof sounds ridiculous. Of course, it is vital to attempt things independently at first, for some amount of time. This time is important because you'll run into trouble and get struck and frustrated. It is exactly here that you should write down notes about why you're stuck. Some examples of what I mean:

- I can't quite get past this bound
- Maybe I don't understand this definition as well as I think I do
- I can't control the size of this object
- I don't have enough information about this set
- I'm not sure how to start

In a similar sense, you should also write down your hopes and dreams: 

- If only this inequality went the other way
- I wish this object had this property I could take advantage of
- I hope this set contains this type of element

By writing these notes, you give structure and shape to point at which you can no longer make progress without a frustrating amount of time. I don't mean to say that you'll never spend a long period of time working on a problem; that's exactly what research should be. But to spend such long frustrating amounds of time with nothing to show and only negative feels building; that will only lead to burnout. Use this process as a form of catharsis and then go out and find answers to these. Look up solutions, talk to classmates and professors. Then go back and answer your list. 

- I couldn't get past this bound because I was comparing to an object that was too big
- I misread a definition or had the wrong technique in mind
- There was a stupid trick or idea that came out of the blue, but now I know it!
- This hope I had turned out to be true with this justification. Perhaps I should keep this inutition in mind for similar situations later on.

That last two are especially important. If you have a taste for something, even if you don't know how to prove it, once the proof in known, it only confirms that you had the correct "sense", which will be more important for research later on. Also sometimes, there are things we'll just never had a good inutuition about so we just trust those that came up with it and add it to our arsenal. Everyone's brains work differently in math and that is part of the beauty of it.
