Hello! My name is Edwin Lin and I'm a graduate student at the University of California Riverside in the [department of mathematics](https://mathdept.ucr.edu/). I earned by Bachelor's in mathematics from California State University East Bay in 2020. I'm a Bay Area native and I'd really like to keep it that way.

My interests currently lie in Fractal Geometry, Optimal Tranport, and Real Analysis, but I hold no qualms about any particular area of mathematics except for the ones that I fear greatly. I also enjoy reading and thinking about mathematics as it relates to education, philosophy and theology. I'm also a big fan of seeing mathematics in action in the real world and I always enjoy seeing interesting applications that I can communicate to others. At the moemnt, I do not yet have a research topic, but I'm hoping that changes soon. 

Outside of math, I enjoy programming, reading, drawing, listening to music, playing piano, hiking, and staring at things on the internet as well as things not on the internet. 

If you'd like to contact me, you can reach my through my email: elin070@ucr.edu

Thank you.
