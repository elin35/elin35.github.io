Hello! My name is Edwin Lin and I'm a graduate student at the University of California Riverside in the [department of mathematics](https://mathdept.ucr.edu/). I earned by Bachelor's in mathematics from California State University East Bay in May 2020. 

My interests currently lie in Fractal Geometry and Geometric Analysis. 

Outside of math, I enjoy programming, reading, listening to music, playing piano, hiking, and staring at things on the internet as well as things not on the internet.
