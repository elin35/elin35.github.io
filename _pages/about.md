Hello! My name is Edwin Lin and I'm a graduate student at the University of California Riverside. I earned by Bachelor's in mathematics from California State University East Bay in May 2020. I'm Taiwanese American, but I'm really just American. My pronouns are denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance.

My main interests right now revolve around mathematics. I'm deeply interested in the grand landscape of mathematics and just how strange it all is. I'm a fan of studying mathematical history, philosophy, and pedagogical writings. For the sake of hirability, I enjoy analysis, applied mathematics, and partial differential equations, but I am by no means adverse to the more algebraic fields.

Outisde of math, I enjoy programming, reading, listening to music, playing piano, hiking, and staring at things on the internet as well as things not on the internet.

Thank you.
