This problem is fairly well known, but as a reference please see Keith Conrad's [Introduction](https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu/blurbs/ringtheory/ideals.pdf) for a brief hinting at the topic at hand. 

Prove that $m\mathbb{Z} + n\mathbb{Z} = \text{gcd}(m,n)\mathbb{Z}$ where $m,n\in\mathbb{Z}^+$. Note that $\alpha\mathbb{Z}$ denotes the principal ideal generated from $\alpha$.
