Everytime I read a piece of advice on some professor's blog (I see you Terry), or whenever I find a source of great wisdom that 
I think will be beneficial on my journey in becoming a mathematician, 
I always think to myself, "wow, this is amazing. I should save this." And I never do. So this is my attempt to do so.

Note that most of these are full of other links that are especially worth exploring, so please shop around within each of these.
