Everytime I read a piece of advice on some professor's blog, or whenever I find a source of great wisdom that 
I think will be beneficial on my journey in becoming a mathematician, 
I always think to myself, "wow, this is amazing. I should save this." And I never do. So this is my attempt to do so.

Note that most of these are full of other links that are especially worth exploring, so please shop around within each of these.

#### General Tips
1. Talk to peers, upperclassmen, faculty.
2. [UC Davis Galois Group (Grad Student Run)](https://galois.math.ucdavis.edu/doku.php?id=wishidknown)
3. [John Baez (General Advice for Grads and Postdocs)](https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/advice.html)
4. [Ravi Vakil (General Advice for Grads)](http://math.stanford.edu/~vakil/potentialstudents.html)

#### General advice on learning mathematics
1. Be vulnerable and honest with yourself about when you need help or aren't certain of something. 
2. Talk to peers, upperclassmen, faculty. 
3. [Terry Tao (Ask yourself dumb questions)](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/ask-yourself-dumb-questions-and-answer-them/)
4. [John Baez (Listing of books for self-study)](https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/books.html)
5. [Terry Tao (Learn and Relearn your field)](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/learn-and-relearn-your-field/)
6. [George Polya (How to solve it wikipedia page)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Solve_It)

#### Subject specific
1. [Jay Cummings (CSUS) History of Real Analysis](https://longformmath.com/papers-and-articles-1)

#### Grant and Scholarship Resources
1. Check your school's website and kindly ask the staff that supports your department. They may know more than faculty.
2. [UCLA's list of funding](https://grad.ucla.edu/funding/#/)
3. [UIUC fellowship finder](https://apps.grad.illinois.edu/fellowship-finder/)
4. Search for "grants" or "fellowships" at the NSF, MAA, AMS, SIAM, or any other big math organization

This list will be continuously updated as I stumble upon more things. Feel free to contact me if any links are no longer function.
